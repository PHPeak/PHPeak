# PHPeak
A PHP framework built for peak performance.

# Origin
This just started as a project for me to learn to manage big projects, and as a sideproject. One of many I may add.  
What you're looking at is version 2.0. The first version was abandoned after 2 years of inactivity. Mainly because the first version did not support composer. This was done because I wanted to learn more about autoloading and supporting custom integrations, however I now see that this was an oversight on my part as composer is such a crucial part of the PHP community.


# Usage
Custom code can be added to the `src` folder. It will be autoloaded :)
